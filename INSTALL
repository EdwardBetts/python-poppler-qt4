Installation:
=============


python-poppler-qt4 installs a single Python module named 'popplerqt4'.

The setup script uses distutils. Use the following commands to build and install
the module:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

To install in /usr instead of /usr/local:

python setup.py install --prefix /usr


Dependencies:
=============

- sip 4.9.1 or newer
- poppler-qt4 0.12.0 or newer (poppler-qt4 is part of poppler)
- Qt4
- PyQt4
- Python (tested with 2.6)

To build the popplerqt4 module, header files of Qt4 and poppler-qt4 and sip
files of PyQt4 are needed (sometimes packaged separately in corresponding -dev
packages).
